# Shadow-GUI Has Been Discontinued

Shadow-GUI is a Lua script made specifically for the Roblox game **Da Hood**. Due to updates in the game’s anti-cheat system, **Shadow-GUI has been officially discontinued** and is no longer maintained or supported.

If you still want to use or study the old Shadow-GUI script, you’re free to do so. While it’s not “free software” in the traditional sense, the source code has always been openly available — never obfuscated or hidden like many other Roblox exploits.

- Parts of the script were sourced from others; proper credit has been given where due.

## Can I Use Shadow-GUI’s Source Code?

Yes, you can freely copy, modify, or use the Shadow-GUI script — **no permission is needed**. However, it’s always appreciated if you credit me:

> Credit me as **Faisal**  
> Shadow-GUI was originally created by **Faisal**

This script is for educational and reference purposes, and while you’re free to use it, please remember the risks involved with outdated cheats in Roblox games like Da Hood.
